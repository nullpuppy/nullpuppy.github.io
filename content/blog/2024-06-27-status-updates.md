So, what's going on with nullpuppy? 2024 has been a shit year. It started off with some layoffs that I was lucky
enough to avoid, but they took a pretty significant toll to my mental health for a bit. I started making some progress
towards improving things around home, and then we got hit with another round of layoffs where I was not so lucky. And
now, two months later, I'm still unemployed, and the market is not great for job seekers right now.

What have I been doing in the meantime? Struggling, a lot, but I think I'm on the otherside of the negatives, at least
for a little bit. I've been diving into more frontend development (some of which can be seen
[here](https://github.com/nullpuppy/frontend-mentor-solutions) and working a bit on a note app, because everyone needs
to make a note app right? I'll have more on that soon, lots of stuff to write up.
