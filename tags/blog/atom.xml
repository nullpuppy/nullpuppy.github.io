        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, what’s going on with nullpuppy? 2024 has been a shit year. It started off with some layoffs that I was lucky
enough to avoid, but they took a pretty significant toll to my mental health for a bit. I started making some progress
towards improving things around home, and then we got hit with another round of layoffs where I was not so lucky. And
now, two months later, I’m still unemployed, and the market is not great for job seekers right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have I been doing in the meantime? Struggling, a lot, but I think I’m on the otherside of the negatives, at least
for a little bit. I’ve been diving into more frontend development (some of which can be seen
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nullpuppy&#x2F;frontend-mentor-solutions&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and working a bit on a note app, because everyone needs
to make a note app right? I’ll have more on that soon, lots of stuff to write up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
